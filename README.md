# OOPHouse
ðŸ“– Description

    This project demonstrates the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java through a real-world example of Buildings, Houses, and Villas.
    It applies Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism to simulate a simple real estate management system.

    The program defines an abstract Building class, extended by House and Villa, each with unique features like rooms, floors, renovation options, and swimming pools. The project showcases constructor    overloading, method overloading, method overriding, and encapsulation in action.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

    Implement and demonstrate the four pillars of OOP.

    Simulate real-world property management using Java.

    Showcase constructor overloading, method overloading, and overriding.

    Build a scalable base for future real estate applications.

ðŸ”‘ Features

    Abstract class Building with common attributes (owner, address).

    Encapsulation with private variables and getter/setter methods.

    Static variable (country) shared across all houses.

    Constructor overloading for flexible object creation.

    Method overloading for house renovation (renovate).

    Inheritance hierarchy â†’ Building â†’ House â†’ Villa.

    Overridden methods (build() and showDetails()) for customization.

ðŸ“Œ Future Enhancements

    Add price and area details for properties.

    Introduce interfaces for rent/sale options.

    Connect with a database for persistent storage.

    Build a GUI or web app for user-friendly interaction.
